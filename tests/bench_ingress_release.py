"""Do announces held by ingress control come back out, on schedule?

A flooding client (F) announces five fresh destinations a second for 70 s,
then stays connected and silent. An observer (B), connected first on its own
TCP connection, records when it hears each of F's destinations.

RTNode follows Python RNS 1.5.2 (PERFORMANCE_STRATEGY.md, "Ingress
control"): the burst ends once the rate is back under the threshold and has
not reached it for 15 s; held announces are released from then on, one every
5 s, fewest hops first (all of F's have the same hops, so oldest first), by a
job that runs every 5 s. So B should hear:
  - during the flood, only the few destinations the node took before it
    detected the burst;
  - nothing more until the node logs "burst over";
  - then one destination about every 5 s, in the order F announced them.

    ../.venv/bin/python tests/bench_ingress_release.py --serial /dev/cu.usbmodem101 --host 192.168.2.125

Resets the node first, and floods only after the bench build's "backbones
off" mark (bench_load.py). Takes about three minutes.
